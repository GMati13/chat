        Args:
            bot (``int`` | ``str``):
                Unique identifier of the inline bot you want to get results from. You can specify
                a @username (str) or a bot ID (int).

            query (``str``):
                Text of the query (up to 512 characters).

            offset (``str``, *optional*):
                Offset of the results to be returned.

            latitude (``float``, *optional*):
                Latitude of the location.
                Useful for location-based results only.

            longitude (``float``, *optional*):
                Longitude of the location.
                Useful for location-based results only.

        Returns:
            On Success, :obj:`BotResults <pyrogram.api.types.messages.BotResults>` is returned.

        Raises:
            :class:`Error <pyrogram.Error>` in case of a Telegram RPC error.
