        """Use this method to request a callback answer from bots. This is the equivalent of clicking an
        inline button containing callback data.

        Args:
            chat_id (``int`` | ``str``):
                Unique identifier (int) or username (str) of the target chat.
                For your personal cloud (Saved Messages) you can simply use "me" or "self".
                For a contact that exists in your Telegram address book you can use his phone number (str).

            message_id (``int``):
                The message id the inline keyboard is attached on.

            callback_data (``bytes``):
                Callback data associated with the inline button you want to get the answer from.

        Returns:
            The answer containing info useful for clients to display a notification at the top of the chat screen
            or as an alert.

        Raises:
            :class:`Error <pyrogram.Error>` in case of a Telegram RPC error.
            ``TimeoutError`` if the bot fails to answer within 10 seconds.
