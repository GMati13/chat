            This decorator will wrap your defined function in a tuple consisting of *(Handler, group)*.

            To reference your own function after it has been decorated, you need to access
            *my_function[0].callback*, that is, the *callback* field of Handler object which is the the
            first element in the tuple.

            filters (:obj:`Filters <pyrogram.Filters>`):
                Pass one or more filters to allow only a subset of UserStatus updated to be passed in your function.

                The group identifier, defaults to 0.
