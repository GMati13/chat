        Args:
            chat_id (``int`` | ``str``):
                Unique identifier (int) or username (str) of the target chat.
                For your personal cloud (Saved Messages) you can simply use "me" or "self".
                For a contact that exists in your Telegram address book you can use his phone number (str).

            action (:obj:`ChatAction <pyrogram.ChatAction>` | ``str``):
                Type of action to broadcast.
                Choose one from the :class:`ChatAction <pyrogram.ChatAction>` enumeration,
                depending on what the user is about to receive.
                You can also provide a string (e.g. "typing", "upload_photo", "record_audio", ...).

            progress (``int``, *optional*):
                Progress of the upload process.
                Currently useless because official clients don't seem to be handling this.

        Returns:
            On success, True is returned.

        Raises:
            :class:`Error <pyrogram.Error>` in case of a Telegram RPC error.
            ``ValueError`` if the provided string is not a valid ChatAction.
