        """Use this method to delete messages, including service messages, with the following limitations:

        - A message can only be deleted if it was sent less than 48 hours ago.
        - Users can delete outgoing messages in groups and supergroups.
        - Users granted *can_post_messages* permissions can delete outgoing messages in channels.
        - If the user is an administrator of a group, it can delete any message there.
        - If the user has *can_delete_messages* permission in a supergroup or a channel, it can delete any message there.

        Args:
            chat_id (``int`` | ``str``):
                Unique identifier (int) or username (str) of the target chat.
                For your personal cloud (Saved Messages) you can simply use "me" or "self".
                For a contact that exists in your Telegram address book you can use his phone number (str).

            message_ids (``iterable``):
                A list of Message identifiers to delete or a single message id.
                Iterators and Generators are also accepted.

            revoke (``bool``, *optional*):
                Deletes messages on both parts.
                This is only for private cloud chats and normal groups, messages on
                channels and supergroups are always revoked (i.e.: deleted for everyone).
                Defaults to True.

        Returns:
            True on success.

        Raises:
            :class:`Error <pyrogram.Error>` in case of a Telegram RPC error.
