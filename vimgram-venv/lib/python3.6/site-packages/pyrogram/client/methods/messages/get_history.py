        You can get up to 100 messages at once.

        Args:
            chat_id (``int`` | ``str``):
                Unique identifier (int) or username (str) of the target chat.
                For your personal cloud (Saved Messages) you can simply use "me" or "self".
                For a contact that exists in your Telegram address book you can use his phone number (str).

            limit (``int``, *optional*):
                Limits the number of messages to be retrieved.
                By default, the first 100 messages are returned.

            offset (``int``, *optional*):
                Sequential number of the first message to be returned. Defaults to 0 (most recent message).
                Negative values are also accepted and become useful in case you set offset_id or offset_date.

            offset_id (``int``, *optional*):
                Pass a message identifier as offset to retrieve only older messages starting from that message.

            offset_date (``int``, *optional*):
                Pass a date in Unix time as offset to retrieve only older messages starting from that date.

            reversed (``bool``, *optional*):
                Pass True to retrieve the messages in reversed order (from older to most recent).

        Returns:
            On success, a :obj:`Messages <pyrogram.Messages>` object is returned.

        Raises:
            :class:`Error <pyrogram.Error>` in case of a Telegram RPC error.
