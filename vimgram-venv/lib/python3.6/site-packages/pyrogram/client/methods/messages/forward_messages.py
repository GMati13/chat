        Args:
            chat_id (``int`` | ``str``):
                Unique identifier (int) or username (str) of the target chat.
                For your personal cloud (Saved Messages) you can simply use "me" or "self".
                For a contact that exists in your Telegram address book you can use his phone number (str).

            from_chat_id (``int`` | ``str``):
                Unique identifier (int) or username (str) of the source chat where the original message was sent.
                For your personal cloud (Saved Messages) you can simply use "me" or "self".
                For a contact that exists in your Telegram address book you can use his phone number (str).

            message_ids (``iterable``):
                A list of Message identifiers in the chat specified in *from_chat_id* or a single message id.
                Iterators and Generators are also accepted.

            disable_notification (``bool``, *optional*):
                Sends the message silently.
                Users will receive a notification with no sound.

        Returns:
            On success and in case *message_ids* was an iterable, the returned value will be a list of the forwarded
            :obj:`Messages <pyrogram.Message>` even if a list contains just one element, otherwise if
            *message_ids* was an integer, the single forwarded :obj:`Message <pyrogram.Message>`
            is returned.

            :class:`Error <pyrogram.Error>` in case of a Telegram RPC error.
