        A chat can be either a basic group, a supergroup or a channel.
        You must be admin to retrieve the members list of a channel (also known as "subscribers").

        Args:
            chat_id (``int`` | ``str``):
                Unique identifier (int) or username (str) of the target chat.

            offset (``int``, *optional*):
                Sequential number of the first member to be returned.
                Defaults to 0 [1]_.

            limit (``int``, *optional*):
                Limits the number of members to be retrieved.
                Defaults to 200, which is also the maximum server limit allowed per method call.

            query (``str``, *optional*):
                Query string to filter members based on their display names and usernames.
                Defaults to "" (empty string) [2]_.

            filter (``str``, *optional*):
                Filter used to select the kind of members you want to retrieve. Only applicable for supergroups
                and channels. It can be any of the followings:
                *"all"* - all kind of members,
                *"kicked"* - kicked (banned) members only,
                *"restricted"* - restricted members only,
                *"bots"* - bots only,
                *"recent"* - recent members only,
                *"administrators"* - chat administrators only.
                Defaults to *"all"*.

        .. [1] Server limit: on supergroups, you can get up to 10,000 members for a single query and up to 200 members
            on channels.

        .. [2] A query string is applicable only for *"all"*, *"kicked"* and *"restricted"* filters only.

        Returns:
            On success, a :obj:`ChatMembers` object is returned.

        Raises:
            :class:`Error <pyrogram.Error>` in case of a Telegram RPC error.
            ``ValueError`` if you used an invalid filter or a chat_id that belongs to a user.
