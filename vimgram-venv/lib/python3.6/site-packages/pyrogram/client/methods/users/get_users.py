        You can retrieve up to 200 users at once.

            user_ids (``iterable``):
                A list of User identifiers (id or username) or a single user id/username.
                For a contact that exists in your Telegram address book you can use his phone number (str).
                Iterators and Generators are also accepted.

        Returns:
            On success and in case *user_ids* was an iterable, the returned value will be a list of the requested
            :obj:`Users <User>` even if a list contains just one element, otherwise if
            *user_ids* was an integer or string, the single requested :obj:`User` is returned.

            :class:`Error <pyrogram.Error>` in case of a Telegram RPC error.
