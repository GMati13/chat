from .handler import Handler


class UserStatusHandler(Handler):
    """The UserStatus handler class. Used to handle user status updates (user going online or offline).
    It is intended to be used with :meth:`add_handler() <pyrogram.Client.add_handler>`

    For a nicer way to register this handler, have a look at the
    :meth:`on_user_status() <pyrogram.Client.on_user_status>` decorator.

    Args:
        callback (``callable``):
            Pass a function that will be called when a new UserStatus update arrives. It takes *(client, user_status)*
            as positional arguments (look at the section below for a detailed description).

        filters (:obj:`Filters <pyrogram.Filters>`):
            Pass one or more filters to allow only a subset of messages to be passed
            in your callback function.

    Other parameters:
        client (:obj:`Client <pyrogram.Client>`):
            The Client itself, useful when you want to call other API methods inside the user status handler.

        user_status (:obj:`UserStatus <pyrogram.UserStatus>`):
            The received UserStatus update.
